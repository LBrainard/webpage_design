<!-- This introduces the History of the pinelands and the story of the Jersey Devil-->
	<p> <h2> <b> History of the Pinelands </b> </h2> </p>
	<hr />
	<br />
	<p>There is a widely known myth that centuries ago, there lived a woman named Mother Leeds. 
It is said that after finding that she was to give birth to her thirteenth child, she 
cursed it in saying, "Let it be the devil!" The story goes on to say that upon it's arrival
the "child" was born a demon with the face of a goat, wings, claws, hooves,and a forked tail, and flew 
away deep into the forest. The true story is very similar to this. In the true tale
of this occurence Daniel Leeds, a traveler from England, begins to publish his own almanac,
however his publications, especially about astrology, did not please the Quakers. After 
years of feuding with the Quakers, he retired from his business. However, his son Titan
Leeds continued his business, as well as the feud with Benjamin Franklin and his almanac.
Benjamin Franklin however, took the feud lightly and therefore predicted the death of Titan
Leeds in October 17, 1733. After the death of Titan Leeds a few years later, it is said that
his death triggered the birth of the Jersey Devil.<p>
